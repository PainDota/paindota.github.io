            <p class="open-sans-body">
                Coaching involves reviewing a replay and teaching a player to correct the mistakes they made in that
                game. When a coach only reviews one or two replays it's difficult to get a complete perspective on the
                student's overarching weaknesses. Some weaknesses may not even show up in specific games.<br><br>
                By looking at multiple replays and evaluating the student as a whole, I'm able to get a holistic view of
                the student and find weaknesses that are consistent across their entire profile.<br><br>
                <bold class="fw-semi-bold">Note: A training plan is not a complete substitute for coaching! While I try to address as many
                    things
                    as possible, there is some benefit that can only be had when the student engages in dialogue with a
                    coach while watching their own replay.

                        <p>I will research your profile in-depth. This will involve the analysis of a dozen or more
                            games over various playing sessions on multiple heroes. I'll analyze your farming patterns,
                            drafting, item builds, team fighting, and every single category of decision making that you
                            make throughout the game. Using this information, I will create a Personalized Practice Plan
                            for you.<br><br>

                        </h3>
                        <p>Other games, such as Valorant, have players who practice aim-routines but DotA players do not
                            practice. This is because they don't know how to practice. By taking the time to assess each
                            student individually, we can create more optimized practice plans for each individual.
                            <br><br>For example, in Valorant or FPS games, you can practice your raw aim through their
                            in-game
                            shooting range or by using third-party programs like AimLabs. I will provide you with a
                            similar training plan with unique practices that will help you fix your shortcomings.
                            <br><br>I will draft up a custom document that targets examples and scenarios you've seen in
                            your
                            games. I will outline what a student is doing wrong and the consequences of their decisions.
                            It will involve solutions on how to practice fixing this behavior and why it works. This
                            will not be copied and pasted from some source material. I will target your problems
                            individually and tell you how to improve.

                            additional practice plan for an existing student than a completely new one.</p>
